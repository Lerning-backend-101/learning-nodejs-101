# Learning Node.js: Beginner Project

Welcome to the **Learning Node.js** project! This repository is designed for interns and beginners to get hands-on experience with the basics of Node.js. You'll find simple examples and exercises covering core Node.js concepts.

## Project Structure

- **index.js**: Entry point for running sample code.
- **functions/**: Contains example scripts for different Node.js modules and features:
	- `1-console.js`: Console operations
	- `2-process.js`: Working with process object
	- `3-file-system.js`: File system operations
	- `4-events.js`: Event handling
	- `5-hash-func.js`: Hashing functions
	- `6-http-sample.js`: Basic HTTP server example
- **log.txt**: Example log file
- **test-api/**: Contains API test collections (Bruno format)
- **package.json**: Project metadata and dependencies

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** and open it in your code editor.
2. Run individual scripts in the `functions/` folder to explore each Node.js concept:
	 ```sh
	 node functions/1-console.js
	 ```
3. Edit and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
4. Use the `test-api/` folder to practice API testing with Bruno or similar tools.

## What You'll Learn

- Node.js runtime basics
- Console and process operations
- File system manipulation
- Event-driven programming
- Hashing and cryptography basics
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- API testing fundamentals

## Getting Started
